This topic about positioning elements on a page appears simple but it is very
easy to get confused with the words :).

References (read them before you start):

This lesson deals with basic usage of position. Thing to remember is
- static is default positioning
- relative position is relative to where the element would have been according
to the standard box layout (and not relative to top of page or browser viewport)
- fixed is absolute position in the visible portion of the browser
- absolute is relative to the first non static parent (or body element by default)

        /* adding a border to all elements so placement of elements is clear */
        * {
            border: thin solid blue;
        }

    /*
    Add appropriate rules with position and other properties to come
    up with the layout as shown in the image. In particular note the following:
    - fixed position of commentary div
    - the width of the paragraphs so that they don't intersect with the commentary
    - the starting position of the ordered lists and position of the list elements
    - all offsets are multiples of 10, so you can use ruler to find the closest values fast.
    - note that width of the paragraph is commentary is different, which selector can
      you use to get this behavior?
    - After you are done with all this and your page is ready, move the browser
    scrollbars, resize the window and see what happens.

    It is a good idea to have pycharm and the browser side by side and keep
    refreshing the page as you edit the rules.

    The Lord of the Rings is a film series consisting of three high fantasy
    adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. They are based on the novel
    The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The films are:

Considered to be one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever
    undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310
    million-$330 million),[3] the entire project took eight years, with the filming
    for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand,
    Jackson's native country.

    Seeing the success of movies, Peter thought that it was a good idea to make prequels to rake in
    some more money. It resulted in a new movie series:
