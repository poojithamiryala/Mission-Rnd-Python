divs and spans are content free containers which can hold other html
elements. Their only purpose is to provide logical containers to divide
sections of the html document. div is a block element (think of it as having a
new line before and after) and span is an inline element.

http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.3

Each division can be applied a style that applies to the elements
in that division.

This avoids to use other elements like tables just to create a multi column
layout.

        Use firebug to figure out the default values of margin and padding for
        divs and spans (computed tab).

        Exercise: add additional id based css rules and other rules
        to create a layout as shown in image.

    This makes it clear that a block level element like a div can container
    other block or inline elements. It is not valid for you to include

    <!--
    Uncomment this and see that pycharm will give a warning in the gutter bar.
    It is not valid to have block elements inside inline elements like a spans
    even if browsers render them.
    <span> Hello <div> there</div> you fool</span>
